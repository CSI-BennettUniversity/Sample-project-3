# Virtual-Resource-Management-System

<h2> Aims And Objectives </h2>

Our project aims to cater to the needs of the students and teachers, who are left largely depended on virtual classroom environments. Managing all the resources which were once physical and could be sorted easily are now a hassle to sort. Students can no longer meet and greet each other as they would have done, had there been no pandemic. Sitting in front of a screen for large durations is not only physically exhausting but has given birth to unprecedented rates of mental health issues. 

Though no one would be able to simulate the physical classes we can try to make the online experience better and more fun to use. This project impacts students and teachers, offering them easier access to resources and helps them with doubt clearing. It also functions as a library to access all sorts of books, documents, news and recording of lectures. The aims can be achieved by use of simple applications like a graphical interface, a profile system and a portal to important resources. 

It also consists of some extra features and integrations like weather notifier and some games that may help the students freshen up themselves. We'll soon be adding a forum for inter-student discussions.
